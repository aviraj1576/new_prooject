## üì¶ **Project Structure**

| Folder/File                | Description                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| `scripts/deploy.js`        | Deployment script                            |
| `uploadAllowlist.js`       | Hashes & uploads allowlist                   |
| `allowlist.js`             | Predefined allowlist (already inside repo ‚úÖ) |
| `allowlist-agent/agent.js` | Monitoring agent                             |

## üñ•Ô∏è **Step-by-Step Setup**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the GitHub Repository**

Open your terminal and clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviraj1576/new_prooject/
cd new_prooject
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install All Dependencies**

Inside your project directory, run:

```bash
npm install
npm install ps-list ethers dotenv @lighthouse-web3/sdk crypto
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

‚úÖ **Note:** No need to manually create `allowlist.js` ‚Äî it already exists inside your repo.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Get Lighthouse API Key**

* Sign up (or login) at: [https://lighthouse.storage/](https://lighthouse.storage/)
* Go to **API Keys** section.
* Generate a new API key.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in root directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following contents:

```env
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key
INITIAL_CID=
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

üëâ You will update `INITIAL_CID` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` shortly.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Allowlist & Upload to Lighthouse**

Simply run:

```bash
node uploadAllowlist.js
```

This will:

* Hash all apps from your `allowlist.js`
* Save hashes into `hashedAllowlist.json`
* Upload file to Lighthouse
* Print **CID** on console output

‚úÖ **Copy the CID shown** and paste it into `.env` file:

```env
INITIAL_CID=your_uploaded_cid_here
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Start Local Blockchain (Hardhat Node)**

In a new terminal window (keep it running):

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

‚úÖ This will simulate your Ethereum blockchain locally.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy Smart Contract**

In another terminal window (in root directory):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Output will show:

```
Deploying contract with account: 0x....
Allowlist contract deployed to: 0xABCDEF....
```

‚úÖ **Copy the contract address** and update `.env`:

```env
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Run Monitoring Agent**

Go to agent folder:

```bash
cd allowlist-agent
```

Start the agent:

```bash
node agent.js
```

---

‚úÖ The agent will:

* Read allowlist CID from deployed smart contract.
* Download hashed allowlist from Lighthouse.
* Monitor your system processes continuously.
* Print `üö® Shadow IT detected` if any unauthorized app is running.

---

## üîÑ **Whenever you want to update the allowlist:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Update `allowlist.js` file (add or remove applications).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Rerun:

```bash
node uploadAllowlist.js
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Take new CID, update `INITIAL_CID` in `.env`.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Rerun deploy:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

---

## üî¨ **Testing & Debugging Tips**

* You can open multiple terminals to monitor:

  * Hardhat node (`npx hardhat node`)
  * Deployment script (`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`)
  * Agent (`node agent.js`)
* Add unauthorized apps manually to test shadow IT detection.
